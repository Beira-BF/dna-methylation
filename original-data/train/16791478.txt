Association of GSTP1 CpG islands hypermethylation with poor prognosis in human breast cancers. 
Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) belongs to a family of phase II metabolic enzymes that can detoxify the carcinogens and cytotoxic drugs by conjugating them with glutathione. Relationship of GSTP1 CpG islands hypermethylation or GSTP1 protein expression with clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancers was studied. The CpG islands hypermethylation status of GSTP1 gene was studied by methylation specific primer assay and GSTP1 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in primary breast cancers. Of 174 breast tumors, 24 (14%) were found to have GSTP1 CpG islands hypermethylation. A significant association was found between GSTP1 CpG islands hypermethylation and large tumor size (P < 0.01) or lymph node metastases (P < 0.05). Relapse-free survival (RFS) rates of patients with GSTP1 CpG islands hypermethylation were significantly poorer than those without it (5-year RFS rates; 60 vs. 86%, P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that GSTP1 CpG islands hypermethylation status was a statistically significant prognostic factor being independent of other conventional prognostic factors. Immunohistochemical study showed that here was a significant association between GSTP1 CpG islands hypermethylation and loss of GSTP1 expression (P < 0.01) but that RFS rates of patients with GSTP1 positive tumors were not significantly different from those with GSTP1 negative tumors. GSTP1 CpG islands hypermethylation, but not GSTP1 protein expression, is associated with a poor prognosis of breast cancers, suggesting that GSTP1 CpG islands hypermethylation has a potential to serve as a clinically useful prognostic factor.

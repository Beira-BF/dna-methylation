RASSF2, a potential tumour suppressor, is silenced by CpG island hypermethylation in gastric cancer. 
RASSF2, a member of the RASSF1 family, has recently been identified as a potential tumour suppressor. We examined methylation status in multiple regions which included the CpG island and spanned the transcription start site of RASSF2 in 10 gastric cancer cell lines, as well as 78 primary gastric cancers and corresponding non-neoplastic gastric epithelia. Hypermethylation of RASSF2 in at least one of the regions examined was detected in seven (70%) of the 10 cell lines; two (20%) exhibited hypermethylation in all the regions examined including the transcription start site and lost expression of RASSF2 mRNA, which could, however, be restored by 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine treatment, while the other five (50%) cell lines exhibited hypermethylation at the 5'- and/or 3'- edge, with four of them expressing RASSF2 mRNA. In primary gastric cancers and corresponding non-neoplastic gastric epithelia, frequencies of RASSF2 methylation ranged from 29% (23 out of 78) to 79% (62 out of 78) and 3% (two out of 78) to 60% (47 out of 78), respectively, at different CpG sites examined. Methylation was frequently observed at the 5'- and 3'- edges, and became less frequent near the transcription start site in both the primary gastric cancers and corresponding non-neoplastic gastric epithelia. Hypermethylation near the transcription start site was mostly cancer-specific. We thus showed that RASSF2 is silenced by hypermethylation near the transcription start site in gastric cancer. Hypermethylation was found initially to occur at the 5'- and 3'- furthest regions of the CpG island in non-neoplastic gastric epithelia, to gradually spreads near the transcription start site to shut down RASSF2 expression, and ultimately to constitute a field-defect placing tissue increased risk for development of gastric cancer.

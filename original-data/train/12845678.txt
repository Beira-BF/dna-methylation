Altered methylation of multiple genes in carcinogenesis of the prostate. 
The methylation status of 7 genes was examined in four cell lines, 36 samples of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 20 samples of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and 109 samples of prostate cancer (PCa), using methylation-specific PCR (MSP): the pi-class glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1), retinoic acid receptor beta 2(RARbeta2), androgen (AR), death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3), O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and hypermethylated in cancer-1 (HIC-1). The frequencies of methylation in PCa were 88% for GSTP1, 78% for RARbeta2, 36% for DAPK, 15% for AR, 6% for TIMP-3, and 2% for MGMT, whereas the values were 11% for AR and DAPK, 6% for TIMP-3, 3% for GSTP1, and 0 for RARbeta2 and MGMT in BPH. Aberrant methylation of the GSTP1 and RARbeta2 was detected in 30% and 20% of PIN, respectively. Most samples of BPH and PCa were positive for HIC-1 methylation. Regarding accumulation of methylated cancer-related genes, there were significant correlations between PCa and BPH as well as PIN and BPH. In the present study, a high frequency of aberrant promoter methylation of the GSTP1 and RARbeta2 was noted in PCa. Our findings suggest that methylation of cancer-related genes may be involved in carcinogenesis of the prostate.
